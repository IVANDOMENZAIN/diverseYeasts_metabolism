# Description
Scripts for performing reporter metabolites analysis using a GEM of **C. intermedia** metabolism and results from DE analysis on RNAseq data for batch growth on diverse carbon sources compared to glucose.

# Prerequisites
Run the scripts in the folder `code/RNAseq_analysis`  and then those in  `code/oxRed_path_addition` prior to any script in this folder.

# Instructions
Run the script `repMets_analysis.m`

# Results
The reporter metabolites analysis for each carbon source are stored in the folder: `results/reporter_metabolites`. A separate `.txt` file is creted for each carbon source compared to glucose. In each file several tables can be found for reporter metabolites amongst 1)all genes, 2) up-regulated genes and 3) down-regulated genes.
